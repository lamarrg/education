This one was done a little differently... The task suggestino was not specific, so basically I create a sqlite database with python (which is not necessary). The creation of tables, adding items, listing and deleting are handled from the command line. I was not too concerned about this feature as I have created plenty of websites that have a more sophisticated database interface.

sqlite> create table todo_list (id integer primary key autoincrement, name text);
sqlite> insert into todo_list (name) values ("go shopping");
sqlite> insert into todo_list (name) values ("wash car");
sqlite> select * from todo_list;
sqlite> delete from todo_list where id = 2;
sqlite> select * from todo_list;
