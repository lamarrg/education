In the heart of a sleepy village, where the sun hung low and warm in the sky, lived a cat named Miso. She wasn’t anyone’s pet, not really—she belonged to the garden.

Every morning, as the mist curled off the grass, Miso would stroll past the old stone gate and into her kingdom. The garden was wild and wonderful, full of tangled vines, sleepy bees, and flowers that nodded gently when she passed.

She moved with purpose, pausing to sniff a blooming lavender bush, then leaping onto a sun-warmed rock to survey the scene. A butterfly fluttered by, and Miso watched it with the calm wisdom of a creature who had seen many springs.

Children from the village would sometimes peek through the fence, hoping for a glimpse of the garden’s quiet queen. But Miso never came when called. She came when the breeze was just right and the petals whispered secrets only she could hear.

As the sun dipped low and painted the garden in amber light, Miso curled up beneath the old rosebush. The world slowed. The flowers leaned in closer. And the garden, once again, held its breath around her.

For Miso, the garden was not just a place—it was home.
