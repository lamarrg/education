# education

This repo is for educational projects. 

Anything that can be considered for learning - whether from a course, ChatGPT, my mind or to figure someting out, will go in this repo. 

To clarify, anything hosted here will be from my work. I may use AI or Google as a resource, to look up concepts or terms that need to be defined. I will NOT be finding/generating code and pasting into a project. 

That being said, if I have already created code on one course that another course requires (example: fizz-buzz), I will use that here. This will also demonstrate the DRY programming principle. (Don't Repeat Yourself)
